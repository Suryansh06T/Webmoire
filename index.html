<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Let’s start with one particle in one dimension. If we somehow know
the <em>position and the momentum</em> of that particle at any time, we
can tell about its position and momentum at other times. This is well
established postulate under classical mechanics. What we further do is
quantize the position and the momentum into <em>discrete</em> steps of
<span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>. Doing this will let us define
some quantities which we will explore later. For now we can give the
description of this system in terms of two numbers representing the
position and the momentum. These are called the <em>quantum numbers</em>
that characterize the state of the system and these give the complete
description of the system, such that applying the commonly known
equations of motion we can know the state of the system or the quantum
numbers at any time. This generalizes to any number of particles and
dimensions, for example for a particle in three dimensional space, we
can describe it in six quantum numbers.</p>
<h4 id="a-priori-axiom">A-priori Axiom</h4>
<p>Let’s now take an example of a <em>particle under simple harmonic
oscillations</em>. The energy of the system being constant <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> which mind you is also discrete so it’s
a value between <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E+\delta E\)</span> classically. Knowing the <span
class="math inline">\(x, p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of the system we know all the quantum
parameters. If we plot <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> vs <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for energies between <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E+\delta E\)</span> we get two ellipses for <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E+\delta E\)</span> .If we overlay a grid of cells
with spacing <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>, the number of cells lying
within the area between the two ellipses gives a count of the accessible
quantum states for energy between <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(E+\delta E\)</span>. To make use of all
this, we need a basis postulate which we can follow to make predictions
with. Such a postulate is called an <em>a-priori axiom</em> can we
assume it to be true in order to make predictions off of it. Of course
we don’t know if the axiom holds or not, we can only verify the
predictions that we can make using it. If the predictions hold
repeatedly, we can with further confidence believe that the axiom indeed
holds. One of the fundamental axioms is “An isolated system in
equilibrium is equally likely to be in any of it’s accessible states
irrespective of time”. There’s nothing in the laws of mechanics that can
contradict this statement and it is a well established axiom in
statistical mechanics. Lets <em>make a simple prediction</em>. Every
state inside the thickness of the ellipse is accessible to the system,
hence called an accessible state. According to our postulate the system
is equally likely to be in any of that accessible state. It follows that
if corresponding to a particular value of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, say <span
class="math inline">\(x_{0}\)</span> if there are more accessible states
compared to other value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> say
<span class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span>. Then the system is more
likely have the quantum number <span
class="math inline">\(x_{0}\)</span> than the quantum number <span
class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span>. From the graph, near <span
class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> there are fewer states accessible to
system compared to near the edge. Thus we conclude the particle is more
likely to be near the edge than the center. This makes sense
intuitively, the particle moves more slowly near the extreme positions
and therefore spends more time there.</p>
<h4 id="ensemble">Ensemble</h4>
<p>It’s true that we can predict the states if we have access to all the
quantum numbers available to us, but for sufficiently large systems such
data is not of interest to us as a statistical viewpoint. Instead of
describing system by it’s quantum parameters, we describe them using
external parameters like: total energy, volume, density, pressure etc.
These parameters together is referred to as the <em>macrostate</em> of
the system. As one can imagine, there are several possible sets of
quantum numbers associated with a singe macrostate, the set is called
the <em>microstate</em> of the system. From our initial postulate we can
say that a system defined by a macrostate will have equal probability of
being in each microstate linked to that macrostate. From these
definitions we <em>define <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(E)\)</span>
as the number of microstates</em> available to system when total energy
is between <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E+\delta E\)</span>. Similarly <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega(E; y_{1}\dots y_{n})\)</span> as the number
of microstates available to the system subject to external parameters
<span class="math inline">\(y_{1}\dots y_{n}\)</span>. Not going into
detailed mathematical analysis, we state that <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega(E)\)</span> <em>scales proportionally
to</em> <span class="math inline">\(E^{f}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the number of quantum parameters. To
grasp this, we turn to the simple harmonic oscillator. It’s obvious that
for larger values of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> the size of
the ellipse will be larger, increasing the microstates, roughly by the
factor of <span class="math inline">\(E^{2}\)</span>. As the number of
dimensions and particles increase, the number of microstates increase
exponentially. For a mole of particles in three dimensions, this scales
proportionally to <span class="math inline">\(E^{1\times
10^{24}}\)</span> , which is hugely exponential.</p>
<h4 id="interactions">Interactions</h4>
<p>If a macrostate is defined by <span class="math inline">\(E_{0};
y_{1}\dots y_{k}\dots y_{n}\)</span> and some constraint <span
class="math inline">\(y_{k}\)</span> is allowed to change, then the
probability that <span class="math inline">\(y_{k}=y\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}(y)\)</span>. This probability is
proportional to the number of microstates available to the system when
<span class="math inline">\(y_{k}=y\)</span>. If we put no
<em>restrictions on <span class="math inline">\(y_{k}\)</span> naturally
it’ll assume a value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}(y)\)</span> maximizes</em>. Hence we
conclude that when a constraint is lifted the system assumes the value
of external parameter where that parameters leads to maximum
microstates. Let us take two systems <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> each in equilibrium. The system as
a whole <span class="math inline">\(A^{\langle 0 \rangle}\)</span> is
isolated and hence the total energy <span
class="math inline">\(E^{\langle 0 \rangle}\)</span> of the system is
conserved. If the subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> are allowed to interact such
that their external parameters <span class="math inline">\(y_{1}\dots
y_{n}\)</span> are fixed only the energies of each system are allowed to
vary. Such statistical ensembles are called canonical ensembles.
<strong>The energy of each <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in
ensemble of many systems does not change by the same amount.</strong> So
we describe the situation in terms of mean energy over all the systems.
More concisely, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \bar{E}=-\Delta
\bar{E}&#39;\)</span> such that total energy change is zero. We call
this type of energy change heat absorbed by the system <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Another type of interaction is when
heat transfer is not possible, instead the external parameters of the
subsystems are allowed to vary. In this case too, we describe the
interaction in terms of change in average energy over ensemble of many
subsystems. This time we call it the net work done on the system <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}=\Delta \bar{E}\)</span>. The work done
by the system is then <span
class="math inline">\(W=-\mathcal{W}\)</span>. For a general interaction
involving both heat exchange and work done we have the expression. <span
class="math inline">\(Q=\Delta \bar{E}+W\)</span>, which is equivalent
to the first law of thermodynamics.</p>
<h4 id="temperature">Temperature</h4>
<p>We study the thermal interactions in the system <span
class="math inline">\(A^{\langle 0 \rangle}\)</span> in more detail. If
the total energy of each subsystem be <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> respectively, we have <span
class="math inline">\(E=E^{\langle 0 \rangle}-E&#39;\)</span>. The total
number of accessible microstates of the system <span
class="math inline">\(A^{\langle 0 \rangle}\)</span> is the given by the
product of accessible microstates of the subsystems <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> . For each accessible microstate
of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> the combined system has the
choice of being in any accessible microstate of <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> . Hence, <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega^{\langle 0
\rangle}(E)=\Omega(E)\Omega&#39;(E&#39;)=\Omega(E)\Omega&#39;(E^{\langle
0 \rangle}-E)\propto \mathbf{P}(E)\)</span>. Hence the systems will
assume the value of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and
consequently <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> such that the
number of accessible microstates is maximized. We wish find the most
probable energy distribution of the subsystems, this can be analytically
achieved by solving <span class="math inline">\(d\mathbf{P} /dE
=0\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}\propto\Omega \cdot\Omega&#39;\,\text{ and }\,\Omega \propto
E^{ f}\,\text{ and } \,\Omega&#39;\propto E&#39;^{f&#39;} \\
\implies \mathbf{P}\propto E^{f}\cdot E&#39;^{f&#39;} \\
\implies \ln \mathbf{P}=f\ln E+f&#39;\ln E&#39;+c \\
\text{Function maximizes when}\, \\
\frac{ \partial \ln \Omega(E) }{ \partial E } -\frac{ \partial \ln
\Omega&#39;(E&#39;) }{ \partial E&#39; } = 0 \\
\implies \frac{ \partial \ln \Omega(E) }{ \partial E } =\frac{ \partial
\ln \Omega&#39;(E&#39;) }{ \partial E&#39; }  \\
\implies\beta(E)=\beta&#39;(E&#39;)  &amp;  &amp; (\text{say} ) \\
\end{align}\]</span> Hence we say that the system is in thermal
equilibrium when this <span class="math inline">\(\beta(E)\)</span>
equals <span class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;(E&#39;)\)</span>. We can
define a convenient quantity <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> such
that, <span class="math inline">\(kT=1 /\beta\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{T}=k\beta=\dfrac{ \partial (k\ln\Omega)
}{ \partial E }=\dfrac{ \partial S }{ \partial E }\)</span>. The peak of
the probability curve <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}(E)\)</span>
is very sharp and decreases rapidly for values far from <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{E}\)</span> where the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}(\tilde{E})\)</span> is maximum. Th.
choice of the temperature variable is really a matter of choice
(different <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and is separate from
the classical idea. Thermodynamically the temperature variable can be
any external variable that shows enough change in value when the system
is in contact with another system not already in thermal equilibrium
with the test system. It can be anything from length, volume, pressure,
etc.</p>
